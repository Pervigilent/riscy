# RISC-Y Business

## Introduction
This repository contains (1) notes and examples from a Verilog text called ``Advanced Chip Design'' by Kishore Mishra and (2) an attempt to implement a RISC-V architecture.

## Chip Design Notes
The folder 'chips' contains notes and examples taken partially from Mishra. (I would strongly discourage use of the Mishra text as it is almost incomprehensible due to poor English.) The text for the notes is in the 'text' folder and the examples are in the 'source' folder. The examples are indexed in a file 'mishra.csv'.

## RISC-V Architecture
The 'riscy' folder, not yet created, will contain my implementation of the RISC-V architecture.
